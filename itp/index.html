<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive
theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation
aspects and applications in program verification, security, and the
formalization of mathematics. This will be the 16th conference in the
ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have
been going since 1988.

<h3>Call for papers</h3>

<h4>Important dates</h4>

<ul>
<li> Abstract submission deadline:  March 12, 2025
<li> Paper submission deadline:     March 19, 2025
<li> Author notification:           May 23, 2025
<li> Camera-ready copy due:         June 27, 2025
</ul>

<h4>Topics</h4>

ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of
interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics
include, but are not limited to, the following:
<ul>
<li> formalizations of computational models
<li> improvements in interactive theorem prover technology
<li> formalizations of mathematics
<li> integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools
<li> verification of security algorithms
<li> industrial applications of interactive theorem provers
<li> formal specification and verification of hardware and software
<li> user interfaces for interactive theorem provers
<li> use of theorem provers in education
<li> concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)
</ul>

<h4>Paper categories and submission</h4>

Regular papers must:

<ul>
<li> be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references
<li> not include an appendix; and
<li> be in LIPIcs format.
</ul>

For detailed instructions for authors on document preparation see the
<a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author">LIPIcs
  instructions for authors</a>.

We also welcome short papers, which can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Such a preliminary report is limited to 6 pages and may consist of an extended abstract. Each of these papers should have the phrase "Short paper" as a subtitle. Accepted submissions in this category will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.

<p>Papers must be prepared in LaTeX using
    the <a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author">lipics-v2021
    style (v2021.1.3)</a> and must be submitted electronically as pdf
    files through HotCRP (link tba).</p>

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of
a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization
for the proof assistant used.

<h4>Publication</h4>

<p>The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's
    <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs">Leibniz
        International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)</a> series in Gold Open
    Access under
    the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY-4.0
        license</a>.</p>

<h3>Registration and Participation</h3>

<p>
Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee.
For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a full registration fee.
For presenters we strongly encourage physical participation since coming to the conference benefits the dissemination of the paper and the overall quality of the conference.
Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.
